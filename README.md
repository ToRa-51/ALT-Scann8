# T-Scann-8-Arduino-JRE (my adaptation to support the UI migrated to PiCamera2, with some additional optimizations)

Fork of original code from Torulf Holmström, from his project T-Scann 8 (http://tscann8.torulf.com/index.html) Licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International License (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/).

This code is the Arduino part for the Super8/Regular8 film scanner project designed by Torulf Holmström (details in his project site: http://tscann8.torulf.com/index.html).
It is a fork of his original code (v1.61) from Torulf, and the original motivation was to perform some improvements I needed for my personal use.
Initially, I just did some refactoring to facilitate further code modifications.
Afterwards, I started to add some modifications and improvements, until the current point where the code is quite different from the original (although the main workflow is still the same).
