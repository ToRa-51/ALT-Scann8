# T-Scann8-UI
Original code from Torulf Holmström, refactored
This code is the UI for the Super8/Regular8 film scanner project designed by Torulf Holmström (details in his site: http://tscann8.torulf.com/index.html)
It is a branch of the original code from Torulf, and the original motivation was to migrate it to PiCamera2.
Initially, I just did some refaxctoring to facilitate further code modifications.
Afterwards, I started to add some modifications and improvements, until the current point where the code is quite different from the original (although the main workflow is still the same).

For now, the code is for my private use, if one day I make it public I'll need to see with Torrulf as he should be tagged as the original author.
